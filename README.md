# Agent-Agnostic Resilient and Parameter-Free Consensus Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of an agent-agnostic, resilient, and parameter-free consensus algorithm. The code is designed to demonstrate the resilience and effectiveness of the consensus method in multi-agent systems, particularly in the presence of misbehaving agents.

## Introduction

This project implements a consensus algorithm that is resilient to outliers and does not require predefined parameters. The algorithm is particularly useful in applications where agents need to reach a consensus despite the presence of faulty or malicious agents. The approach is demonstrated through various simulations within the provided Jupyter notebook.

## Features

- **Agent-Agnostic**: The algorithm does not rely on agent-specific parameters.
- **Resilient**: Capable of reaching consensus even with a significant number of misbehaving agents.
- **Parameter-Free**: No need for tuning parameters related to resilience or consensus.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
